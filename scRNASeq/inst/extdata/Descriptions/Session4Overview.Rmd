In this session we will cover scRNA processing in python from the R session using the R reticulate package and the python AnnData and Scanpy packages:

* Introduction to reticulate package.
* Loading scRNA data to AnnData objects.
* Processing scRNA as AnnData in Scanpy.
* Export of Scanpy processed AnnData to Loom.
* Import of Loom to SingleCellExperiment.
