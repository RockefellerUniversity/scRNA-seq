### Overview

In this course we are going to introduce basic analysis for single-cell RNAseq, with a specific focus on the 10X system. The course is divided into three sessions. In the first session, we will introduce how to interpret the Cell  Ranger QC report and how to do analysis with the LOUPE Browser. We will also demonstrate the customized analysis we can support right know. In the Second session, we will demonstrate how to process scRNAseq data and make QC reports with Seurat. In the third session, we will discuss how to to do more advanced analysis and QC with Bioconductor packages. 

Exercises and answer sheets are included to help you practice techniques and provide examples.
